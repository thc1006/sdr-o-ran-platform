IEEE Communications Standards Magazine
Special Issue: "6G from the Sky: Enhancing the Connectivity via Non-Terrestrial Networks"
June 2026 Issue

**Subject:** Manuscript Submission - "Cloud-Native SDR-O-RAN Platform for Non-Terrestrial Networks: A Standards-Compliant Open-Source Implementation"

Dear Guest Editors,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript titled **"Cloud-Native SDR-O-RAN Platform for Non-Terrestrial Networks: A Standards-Compliant Open-Source Implementation"** for consideration in the IEEE Communications Standards Magazine Special Issue on "6G from the Sky: Enhancing the Connectivity via Non-Terrestrial Networks" (June 2026).

## Manuscript Overview

This paper presents the first open-source, production-ready implementation of an integrated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) platform specifically designed for Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) operations. The platform achieves full compliance with 3GPP Release 18/19 NTN specifications and O-RAN Alliance standards (v12.00), while incorporating advanced features including AI/ML-driven resource optimization, NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Cryptography, and cloud-native orchestration.

## Relevance to Special Issue

This work directly addresses the special issue's scope and topics of interest:

1. **NTN Network Architecture:** Complete end-to-end architecture integrating SDR ground station, O-RAN components (gNB, Near-RT RIC, xApps), and cloud-native orchestration

2. **Standardization and Regulation:** Full 3GPP Release 18/19 compliance including Doppler compensation, timing advance, satellite-specific PHY/MAC, and O-RAN E2/A1 interface implementation

3. **AI-Driven Network Management:** Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO/SAC) framework for autonomous RAN optimization with explainability (SHAP)

4. **Security and Privacy:** Post-Quantum Cryptography (NIST FIPS 203 ML-KEM-1024, FIPS 204 ML-DSA-87) across all O-RAN interfaces

5. **Experimental Testbed:** Comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrating LEO latency 47-73ms, GEO latency 267-283ms, throughput 80-95 Mbps, and 99.9% availability

## Key Contributions

The manuscript makes significant contributions to the 6G NTN ecosystem:

- **First Open-Source Integrated Platform:** Complete implementation (8,814 lines of production code) publicly available, enabling rapid innovation and standardization efforts

- **Cost-Effective Solution:** 60-75% CAPEX reduction ($23.5K vs. $500K-$1M) compared to commercial ground stations, lowering barriers to NTN research and deployment

- **Production-Ready Implementation:** Comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and deployment automation achieving 30-minute end-to-end deployment

- **Standards-Driven Approach:** Detailed analysis of 3GPP NTN and O-RAN specifications with implementation insights, lessons learned, and best practices valuable to the standardization community

- **Forward-Looking Security:** Early adoption of NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standards (finalized August 2024), positioning the platform for quantum-resistant 6G deployments

## Novelty and Originality

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to:
1. Integrate SDR, O-RAN, and NTN in a production-ready, open-source platform
2. Implement NIST PQC across O-RAN interfaces for quantum-resistant NTN security
3. Apply Deep Reinforcement Learning to O-RAN xApps specifically optimized for NTN dynamics (satellite mobility, Doppler shift, intermittent connectivity)
4. Provide comprehensive cost-benefit analysis demonstrating feasibility of cost-effective NTN ground stations

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration for publication in any other journal or conference.

## Target Audience

This paper will be of significant interest to:
- **Standards Bodies:** 3GPP and O-RAN Alliance members working on NTN standardization
- **Telecom Operators:** Organizations planning NTN service deployment and seeking cost-effective solutions
- **Academic Researchers:** Universities and research institutions conducting 6G and NTN research
