## Migration Guide

### From Manual Deployment

If you have existing manual deployments:

1. **Inventory Existing Resources**
   ```bash
   aws eks list-clusters
   aws ec2 describe-vpcs
   ```

2. **Import Existing Resources**
   ```bash
   terraform import aws_eks_cluster.main cluster-name
   terraform import aws_vpc.sdr_oran vpc-xxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. **Validate State**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

### From Previous IaC Tools

If migrating from CloudFormation or other tools:

1. Export existing configuration
2. Map resources to Terraform
3. Test in development environment
4. Migrate production with blue-green approach

## Upgrade Path
