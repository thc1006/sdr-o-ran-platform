## 4. NTN-Specific Parameters and Procedures

### 4.1 Timing and Synchronization Parameters

**cellSpecificKoffset_r17:**
- **Purpose:** Compensates for satellite-specific timing offsets
- **Range:** 0 to 1023 (representing 0 to 33.28 ms in steps of 32.5 Î¼s)
- **Application:** Broadcast in SIB19-NTN
- **Usage:** UE applies offset during initial synchronization
- **Update Frequency:** Varies based on satellite orbit type
  - GSO: Infrequent updates (hours to days)
  - LEO: Frequent updates (minutes to hours)

**Implementation Requirements:**
```
K_offset_actual = cellSpecificKoffset_r17 Ã 32.5 Î¼s
T_total = T_measured + K_offset_actual
```

**ta-Common_r17 (Common Timing Advance):**
- **Purpose:** Compensates for propagation delay to satellite
- **Calculation:** Based on satellite ephemeris data and UE location
- **Range:** 0 to 20,512 Î¼s (for GEO) or extended range for specific orbits
- **Broadcast:** System Information Block (SIB19-NTN)
- **UE Application:** Used for initial random access timing

**Calculation Method:**
```
TA_common = 2 Ã distance / speed_of_light
where distance = satellite_altitude / cos(elevation_angle)
```

**For GEO Satellite Example:**
- Altitude: 35,786 km
- Minimum elevation: 10 degrees
- Maximum TA_common: ~242 ms

**For LEO Satellite Example:**
- Altitude: 600 km
- Minimum elevation: 10 degrees
- Maximum TA_common: ~4 ms

### 4.2 Autonomous Timing Advance Updates

Due to satellite motion (especially for NGSO), timing advance must be continuously updated:

**Doppler-Based TA Adjustment:**

1. **UE-Based Autonomous Updates**
   - UE calculates satellite velocity from ephemeris
   - Derives Doppler shift and applies frequency compensation
   - Updates TA autonomously without network signaling
   - Reduces signaling overhead significantly

2. **Update Frequency Requirements**
   - LEO satellites: Every 1-5 seconds
   - MEO satellites: Every 10-30 seconds
   - GEO satellites: Rarely (quasi-static)

3. **Ephemeris Data Provision**
   - Broadcast via SIB19-NTN
   - Contains satellite position and velocity vectors
   - Valid for specific time windows (typically 3-6 hours)
   - Requires periodic refresh

**TA Update Algorithm:**
```
TA(t+Ît) = TA(t) + (Îd / c) Ã 2
where:
  Îd = change in satellite distance
  c = speed of light (3 Ã 10^8 m/s)
```

### 4.3 Doppler Compensation

**Frequency Offset Characteristics:**

For L-band (1.5 GHz) NTN:
- **LEO Maximum Doppler:** Â±40 kHz
- **MEO Maximum Doppler:** Â±15 kHz
- **GEO Maximum Doppler:** <100 Hz

**Compensation Mechanisms:**

1. **Pre-Compensation at UE**
   - UE calculates expected Doppler shift
   - Adjusts transmit frequency accordingly
   - Ensures signal arrives at satellite with correct frequency

2. **Common Doppler Compensation**
   - Network broadcasts common Doppler reference
   - Reduces per-UE compensation requirements
   - Effective for spot beam centers

3. **Residual Doppler Handling**
   - Receiver must handle remaining frequency offset
   - Typically Â±2-5 kHz after pre-compensation
   - Standard NR receivers can accommodate this range

**Doppler Calculation Formula:**
```
f_doppler = (v_radial / c) Ã f_carrier
where:
  v_radial = radial velocity component
  c = speed of light
  f_carrier = carrier frequency
```

### 4.4 HARQ and ARQ Adaptations

**HARQ RTT Adjustments:**

Standard terrestrial NR assumes 8 ms HARQ RTT. NTN requires extensions:

- **LEO NTN:** 10-40 ms HARQ RTT
- **GEO NTN:** 500-550 ms HARQ RTT

**Consequences:**
- Increased number of HARQ processes required
- Larger buffer requirements at transmitter and receiver
- Modified scheduling algorithms to account for long delays

**RLC ARQ Enhancements:**
- Longer timer values for acknowledgment waiting
- Increased window sizes for sustained throughput
- Optimized polling mechanisms

## Appendix B: Calculation Examples

### B.1 Timing Advance Calculation for GEO

Given:
- Satellite altitude: 35,786 km
- Elevation angle: 30 degrees
- Speed of light: 299,792 km/s

Distance to satellite:
```
d = altitude / sin(elevation) = 35,786 / sin(30Â°) = 71,572 km
```

One-way propagation delay:
```
t_prop = d / c = 71,572 / 299,792 = 238.7 ms
```

Timing Advance (round-trip):
```
TA = 2 Ã t_prop = 477.4 ms
```

### B.2 Doppler Shift Calculation for LEO

Given:
- Satellite altitude: 600 km
- Satellite velocity: 7.5 km/s
- Carrier frequency: 2 GHz
- Maximum radial velocity: 7.5 km/s (worst case)

Maximum Doppler shift:
```
f_doppler = (v_radial / c) Ã f_carrier
f_doppler = (7,500 / 299,792,000) Ã 2,000,000,000
f_doppler = 50 kHz
```

For L-band (1.5 GHz):
```
f_doppler = (7,500 / 299,792,000) Ã 1,500,000,000 = 37.5 kHz
```

### B.3 HARQ Process Requirement

For LEO with 30 ms RTT and 2 ms TTI (Transmission Time Interval):

Minimum HARQ processes:
```
N_HARQ = ceil(RTT / TTI) = ceil(30 / 2) = 15 processes
```

Standard NR uses 8 processes (8 ms RTT), so LEO requires at least double.
